this project represnt weighted directed graph, methods and algorithms
first, we implented the node and edge interfaces (representing all functions and method that
vertex and edge shoud have s.t adding/removing/update valute etc..)
seccond we implented the graph interface that include some methods:
such as build a new graph;
adding vertex to the graph;
connect between vertexes;
remove edges and verexes;
deep clone of the graph;
and more usefull methods.
and last, we built the algorithm part,
in that class we implented some graph algorithm methods such as:
is connected - returns true/false if the graph is strongly connected
shortest path distance- returns the shortest path distance betwin source vertex - to destination
shortest path - returns a list that includr all vertexes from source to distnance

we added 2 algorithms for check and search in the graph, bfs and dijkstra.
and at last, there is a method that save the graph object to json file and method to load graph from json file
